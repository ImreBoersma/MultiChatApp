# MultiChatApp Exercise

## Introduction

Welcome to the MultiChatApp exercise from HAN (Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen). This exercise focuses on developing a multi-user chat application, allowing users to communicate in real-time across different devices. The exercise aims to enhance your understanding of networking, user interfaces, and collaborative app development.

## Requirements

Before you start working on the MultiChatApp exercise, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Programming knowledge in a suitable language (e.g., Java, Python, etc.).
- Familiarity with networking concepts (sockets, protocols, etc.).
- Basic understanding of user interface development (if applicable).
- Development environment and tools (IDE, version control, etc.).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the MultiChatApp exercise:

1. Clone or download the exercise repository from the provided source.
2. Set up your development environment and import the project.
3. Review the project's structure and existing codebase.

## Exercise Goals

The MultiChatApp exercise aims to achieve the following goals:

- Implement a server-client architecture for real-time communication.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages.
- Handle multiple concurrent connections and chat rooms.
- Implement user authentication and security measures.
- Enhance the user experience with features like message formatting, notifications, etc.

## Instructions

1. Start by understanding the existing codebase and project structure.
2. Implement the server-side logic for handling connections, messages, and chat rooms.
3. Develop the client-side interface for sending and receiving messages.
4. Test the application locally and fix any bugs or issues.
5. Gradually add advanced features like authentication, room management, etc.
6. Collaborate with peers, seek assistance, and discuss challenges.
7. Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
8. Document your progress, challenges faced, and solutions found.

## Resources

- Consult the provided learning materials and lectures related to networking and user interface development.
- Make use of relevant programming libraries and frameworks (if allowed).
- Collaborate with fellow students and instructors to seek guidance and share insights.

## Submission

Once you've completed the MultiChatApp exercise, follow the submission guidelines provided by your course instructors. This might include submitting your code, documentation, and potentially giving a presentation on your implementation.

## Conclusion

The MultiChatApp exercise is a hands-on opportunity to apply your programming skills in developing a real-time chat application. By successfully completing this exercise, you'll gain valuable experience in networking, user interface design, and collaborative coding.
